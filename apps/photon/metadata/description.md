Photon Docker Image

## Important Notes

### Warning: Large File Sizes

* The Photon index file is fairly large and growing steadily. As of the beginning of 2025, around 200GB is needed for the full index, and it is growing by 10-20GB per year.
* Ensure you have sufficient disk space available before running the container.
* The initial download and extraction process may take a considerable amount of time. Depending on your hardware, checksum verification and decompression may take multiple hours.
